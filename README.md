# Bootcamp of applied data science of [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/bootcamp/data-science-aplicada/matriculas-abertas)
We are going to immerse ourselves in the ocean of Data Science by developing real projects in the health area divided into 6 modules.
We will delve into data analysis techniques, statistics, modeling and data visualization in a practical and applied way, scaling your knowledge to bring new opportunities, whether in the company where you work, whether in your own business or in a new career.
You will learn Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and several other Python libraries; understand the workflow of a Data Science project; you will know how to structure and communicate your results to justify the analysis and conclusions, showing how important the role of data is to optimize processes and results.

## Module 01: Python and pandas for real data analysis
In this module we will learn how to use Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to explore the financial data of SUS, more precisely the expenses per Federative Unit over the years. The challenges start with the acquisition of data on a government platform and its possible problems, going through the reading of these data with Pandas until the creation of hypotheses in the area of health, which should always be careful, simulating the daily challenges of a scientist of data.

## Module 02: Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
In this module, we will continue to analyze the financial data of SUS. We go deeper into the treatment and manipulation of data for more complex analyzes, using more advanced features of Pandas and the Python Language as a whole.
External data sources will be used to enrich the exploratory analysis and make more accurate comparisons between the different states. In addition, we will discuss more about good visualization practices, interpretation of graphs and their construction with Seaborn.

## Module 03: Statistics with python for data analysis
We arrived at module 3 and it's time to dive into the statistics! We will work with the PeNSE (National School Health Survey) database and use statistical concepts to deepen our understanding of the health of young people and adolescents, creating and validating hypotheses with statistical tests.
To assist in this journey, our main tool will be Statsmodels, a Python library for statistical analysis.

## Module 04: Time series analysis
In this module we will discover what time series are and study their peculiarities.
Any theoretical framework acquired so far will be applied to understand the nuances involving the time series. From descriptive statistics, through exploratory analysis and arriving at predictions, always in an applied and practical way using specific tools for this type of data, such as the StatisModel and Prophet developed by Facebook.
In addition to working with time series, we will learn how to create a Data Science application using Streamlit in an extra course.

## Module 05: Treatment, Analysis and Applied Machine Learning
This module will start the development of a practical project that will go through the entire workflow in Data Science, from the understanding of the problem, treatment and analysis of the data to the proposed solution using Machine Learning.
We will work with data from COVID-19 from Sírio Libanês hospital, focusing this module on the treatment and analysis of data to deeply understand the problem we are dealing with and propose possible solutions.
From now on, everything you have learned over these months will be put into practice to help propose solutions to real problems in a hospital. You will face real challenges from a Data Scientist in the healthcare field.

## Module 06: Models, metrics and validations in Machine Learning
In the last module we applied all our knowledge to analyze data from COVID-19, understand some of the challenges of hospitals in times of pandemic and propose solutions based on data analysis.
Our solution proposal was to use Machine Learning models, but to make this possible we need to deepen our knowledge in this area, testing more advanced models, using metrics appropriate to the problem and validating correctly. In this module we will work on all these fronts to make our solution a viable proposal.
